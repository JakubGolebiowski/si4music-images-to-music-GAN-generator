<p>
  Main goal was to make SI model based on keras GAN Neuaral Network for changing series of images into music. Model was trained on 7500 examples made by authors. Every example contains 5 seconds of classical music with 5 images 640x480 pixels. Models were trained on google collab with 10.000, 30.000, 50.000 and 100.000 of epochs. Best modeal was with 50.000 epochs, 100.000 was too much overfitted.
